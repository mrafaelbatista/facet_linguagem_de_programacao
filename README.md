## About Programming Languages Course
I start classes to talk about Object Orientation (OO), is presented the fundamental OO concepts (abstraction, heritage, polymorphism, encapsulation), and many exercises to practice these concepts. Next, talk about file management (CSV or text), and error treatment. For last, to create a project with Django to apply all concepts studied, and to experiment with “web development”.
